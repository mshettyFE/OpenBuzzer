# Downloading Code and Setting up Environment

An important note: I developed this on a Windows machine using WSL. I have no reason to believe that this code won't work across platforms, but your mileage may vary.

You first need to download VSCode and get the PlatformIO extension.

VSCode can be downloaded from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/), while the PlatformIO instructions can be found [here](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode). The [quick start guide](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html#quick-start) will give you an idea of the basic functionality of the extension.

You will also need the C/C++ Extension Pack (Can search and install with extension manager )

Once the above development tools are installed, open up a terminal and download the repository with the command

```
git clone https://github.com/mshettyFE/OpenBuzzer.git
```

Fire up VSCode, and click on the PlatformIO icon on the left hand taskbar.
